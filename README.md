Текст к README в Ghost Game

The beginning of this very small project was like this:

In 2016, in June, right at the beginning, I came up with the idea to create my own game. But after a while, I realized, that it would be very difficult for "an almost 12-year-old boy". And, I, with pain in my heart because it was very interesting for me to postpone this idea for a couple of years. "Until 14" - as I said then.

And so, on September 13, 2018 I decided to start. In 2015, like my mother bought me a book "Programming for children" with scratch and python. So I decided to start with python, because a couple of days ago I was looking at scratch and it didn't work for me (especially not for me). that it is some kind of childish). And so I created my first program from the book - Ghost Game (the original script without changes in first_script file). This is how I entered the programming world.

After 1.5 years - 20.04.2020, I solved the problems with Tproger and GeekBrains, and connected the flash drive to save my scripts and found my first script. I opened it, played it, transferred it to PyCharm and then I came up with the idea to change it and add new chips. During this day (20.04.2020) I completely rewritten the code and it turned out as in the script ghost_game.
